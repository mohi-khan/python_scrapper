The most widely syndicated columnist in the world and a true household name, \\u003cem\\u003eDear Abby\\u003c/em\\u003e is well-known for sound, compassionate advice, delivered with the straightforward style of a good friend. Share a laugh, shed a tear or learn something new every day with Dear Abby.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\u003ch2\\u003eAbout the Author\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\r\\n    \\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eDear Abby\\u003c/em\\u003e is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, whose career as an advice columnist began early. When Jeanne was 14 and needed a little extra spending money, her mother asked, \\\"How do you intend to earn it?\\\" Her mother, Pauline Phillips, had more in mind than the usual household chores. She had recently started writing a nationally syndicated advice column under the pseudonym Abigail Van Buren. A deal was struck, beginning a lifelong partnership.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\u003cp\\u003eAs she helped her mother answer incoming letters from advice-seeking teens, Phillips discovered that she truly loved the work. She wrote for the column behind the scenes until December 2000, when Pauline Phillips recognized Jeanne Phillips as co-creator of \\u003cem\\u003eDear Abby\\u003c/em\\u003e and officially retired.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\u003cp\\u003eToday, Phillips dispenses advice, offers comfort (or a reality check) and settles disputes with the same mix of wit and wisdom that endeared her mother to millions of readers and turned \\u003cem\\u003eDear Abby\\u003c/em\\u003e into a cultural icon. The times have changed, but \\u003cem\\u003eDear Abby\\u003c/em\\u003e's appeal hasn't. Nor have the issues and irritations that fill Phillips' mailbox and inbox.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\r\\n    \\u003cp\\u003eCheating spouses, angst-ridden teens, bossy mothers-in-law and annoying neighbors share space with stories of everyday kindness and heartbreaking tragedy. It's Phillips' unique ability to read between the lines and respond knowledgeably with compassion and humor that wins her the loyalty of her millions of fans.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\u003cp\\u003eRecognizing the honest and valuable advice Phillips has provided to readers, she has received awards from the National Office of Drug Policy, American Academy of Dermatology for excellence in public education of dermatology issues, American Ex-Prisoners of War, Overeaters Anonymous and the national Minority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program. She is the recipient of the 2015 Proxmire Award for leadership in public awareness of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and the Hearing Loss Association of America's 2015 Walter T. Ridder Award. In 2007, PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) honored Phillips with its first \\\"Straight for Equality\\\" Award for her support of LGBT equality.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\u003cp\\u003eWorking with the Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration, Phillips has regularly assisted in providing important information to her readers on a variety of topics to improve their daily lives. Her impact in this endeavor was recognized with multiple entries in the Congressional Record. In addition, she has been an Ambassador and National Supporter of the National Women’s Health Week of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women’s Health.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\u003cp\\u003eIn 2018, Phillips received a PhD from Columbia College in Columbia, South Carolina. Phillips is one of few laypersons ever to be granted a prestigious Life Consultant membership in the Group for Advancement of Psychiatry (GAP), an organization of nationally respected psychiatrists dedicated to shaping psychiatric thinking, public programs and clinical practice in mental health. In addition, Phillips sat on the Board of Judges for the Talbots Charitable Foundation Women's Scholarship Fund, as well as the Advisory Boards of the National Alzheimer's Association, the Children's Rights Council, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the National Kidney Foundation.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\u003cp\\u003eThe National Society of Newspaper Columnists honored Phillips in 2016, and in 2017 she founded the annual Dear Abby College Columnist Scholarship Contest to recognize talented college newspaper columnists.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\u003cp\\u003eMultiple generations of newspaper readers have turned to \\u003cem\\u003eDear Abby\\u003c/em\\u003e for counsel and advice, and she remains beloved and relatable to the digital era with a devoted online following. Phillips has been profiled in The New York Times and featured on \\\"The Steve Harvey Show,\\\" “Extra” and “Entertainment Tonight” recently.

      "DEAR READERS: My New Year's column has become an annual tradition since 1973. These New Year's resolutions are based on the original credo of Alcoholics Anonymous. I have taken the liberty of using that theme with some variations of my own:Just for today I will live through this day only, and not set far-reaching goals to try to overcome all my problems at once. I know I can do something for 24 hours that would appall me if I felt I had to keep it up for a lifetime.Most teen-agers do not know the facts about drugs, AIDS, and how to prevent unwanted pregnancy. It's all in Abby's updated, expanded booklet, \"What Every Teen Should Know.\" To order, send a business-size, self-addressed envelope, plus check or money order for $3.95 ($4.50 in Canada) to: Dear Abby, Teen Booklet, P.O. Box 447, Mount Morris, Ill. 61054. (Postage is included.)DEAR ABBY: Six years ago, my husband and I went to the Netherlands to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. We had planned and saved for the trip for many years. Another married couple, our best friends, were going with us. My mother had had several operations for cancer, but her doctor said she could live another six months to a year.DEAR ABBY: When my dog \"Robert\" died, I received an unusual memorial from a friend. It was such a good idea, I want to pass it along. A donation was sent in Robert's memory to the Companion Animal Fund of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University. The purpose of the fund is to support pet health research, and to purchase critically needed surgical and diagnostic equipment. Other colleges of veterinary medicine must have similar funds.DEAR ABBY: I read your \"chuckle for today\" in which you mentioned my late husband, George Jessel. Thank you.Hot off the press -- Abby's new booklet, \"The Anger in All of Us and How to Deal With It.\" To order, send a long, business-size, self-addressed envelope, plus check or money order for $3.95 ($4.50 in Canada) to: Dear Abby, Anger Booklet, P.O. Box 447, Mount Morris, Ill. 61054. (Postage is included.)DEAR ABBY: Several years ago, you printed several letters concerning older people who had heard music inside their heads. I would appreciate any information you can give me, because my 92-year-old mother is experiencing those symptoms and needs reassurance that she is not \"going crazy.\"DEAR ABBY: I'm in my late 60s and profoundly deaf. I also have a severe case of tinnitus, which is a chronic ringing sensation in my ears. My case is unbelievable. The sounds might be compared to a bad LSD trip without psychedelic visions. They sometimes last as long as four days.This one's for everybody, from teens to seniors.
